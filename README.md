crossword-maker
===============

A crossword generator/creator interface for the browser. It's not really
production ready, I just wanted to tie together a few separate projects into one
cohesive whole.

Uses components from the following projects:

* https://github.com/satchamo/Crossword-Generator (Matt Johnson)
* https://github.com/jweisbeck/Crossword (jweisbeck)

Usage
---------------
This project requires NPM, Bower and Browserify.

To get set up,

1. Check out the repo.
2. Run npm install, bower install.
3. Build the source with browserify js/app.js>built/app.js

Protip: You can use Beefy to develop this using "beefy js/app.js:built/app.js".
